# Time-Series-PIB

## A Brief Explanation
The purpose of this project is to find a model with a good fit with the Brazilian PIB (GDP) time serie, aiming to forecast september, october, november and december 2019. The time serie is a set of 56 data points, from january 2015 to august 2019, and it was partitioned into two parts, validation (a set of 48 data points) and test (a set of 8 data points) datasets, a proportion of 85% and 15%. The project was presented at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) Time Series Analisys class.
